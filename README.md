## Introduction
Welcome to the Customer Care Bot! This README provides an overview of the approach, methods, decisions, assumptions, and instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Approach and Methods

The Chatbot is designed to act as a customer support agent for an e-commerce site. It leverages the OpenAI language model for conversational interactions. The key functionalities include answering customer queries, providing product recommendations, and extracting order IDs and product preferences.

## Decisions Taken

1. **Language Model:** OpenAI's GPT-3.5 is used for generating responses and maintaining conversations.
2. **Memory Management:** A ConversationBufferMemory is employed to store and manage chat history.
3. **Info Extraction:** An InfoExtraction module is created to extract order IDs and product preferences from conversations.

## Assumptions

1. Users will interact with the bot in a conversational manner.
2. The bot will maintain context within a session but will not store information across sessions(only locally for now).
3. Users are interested in receiving accurate and helpful responses.
