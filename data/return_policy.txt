Return Policy

We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase from our e-commerce store. If for any reason you're not happy with your order, we offer a hassle-free return policy to make your shopping experience worry-free.

30-Day Return Period

You have 30 days from the date of delivery to initiate a return for eligible items. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately, we can't offer you a refund or exchange.

Eligibility

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, in the same condition that you received it, and in its original packaging. It must also have the original tags and labels.

Non-Returnable Items

Certain items are exempt from being returned. These include perishable goods, intimate or sanitary goods, gift cards, and downloadable software products.

Return Process

To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team with your order number and details about the product you would like to return. We will guide you through the return process.

Refunds

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within a certain number of days.

Exchanges

If you wish to exchange an item for a different size, color, or product, please contact our customer service team. We will assist you with the exchange process.

Shipping Costs

Return shipping costs are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, if the return is due to a product defect or an error on our part, we will cover the return shipping costs.
